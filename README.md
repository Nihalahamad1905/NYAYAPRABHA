  <h2>Technology Stack</h2>

  <h3>Frontend</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Provides the structural foundation of the website, ensuring clear and organized content presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Enhances visual appeal and user experience with engaging design elements and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Empowers dynamic interactions, form validations, and seamless navigation, making the website intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
    <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> Offers a comprehensive framework of pre-built components and styling options, streamlining development and ensuring a consistent, visually appealing interface.</li>

  <h2>Real-Time Response Updates</h2>
