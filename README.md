  <h2>Technology Stack</h2>

  <h3>Frontend</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Provides the structural foundation of the website, ensuring clear and organized content presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Enhances visual appeal and user experience with engaging design elements and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Empowers dynamic interactions, form validations, and seamless navigation, making the website intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
    <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> Offers a comprehensive framework of pre-built components and styling options, streamlining development and ensuring a consistent, visually appealing interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Backend</h3>

  <h2>Real-Time Response Updates</h2>

  <p>WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) facilitate real-time communication between the frontend and backend, enabling instant status updates for complaints without requiring page refreshes. This keeps users informed about the progress of their complaints, fostering transparency and trust.</p>
