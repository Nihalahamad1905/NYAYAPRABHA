#Technology Stack:

#Frontend:
HTML5: Provides the structural foundation of the website, ensuring clear and organized content presentation.
CSS3: Enhances visual appeal and user experience with engaging design elements and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices.
JavaScript: Empowers dynamic interactions, form validations, and seamless navigation, making the website intuitive and user-friendly.
Bootstrap: Offers a comprehensive framework of pre-built components and styling options, streamlining development and ensuring a consistent, visually appealing interface.

#Backend:
